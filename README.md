Please note that I am currently updating this repository with all the utilities / functions I developed during my PhD at the Centre of Human Brain Health (Birmingham, UK). If you spot an issue / bug, please contact me. Any help / feedback is welcome.

List of scripts and brief description

Utilities:
- Signal to Noise Ratio: Calculates the SNR of an fMRI image, with the possibility of specifying a mask.
- Coord Matrix MNI: transforms MNI coordinates from MNI space to matrix space (and viceversa)
