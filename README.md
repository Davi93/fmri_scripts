This repository contains function and scripts that I wrote during my PhD. 
Please note that I am currently updating this repository. If you spot an issue / bug, please contact me. Any help / feedback is welcome.

List of functions/scripts and brief description:
Utilities:
- Signal to Noise Ratio: Calculates the SNR of an fMRI image, with the possibility of specifying a mask.
- Coord Matrix MNI: transforms MNI coordinates from MNI space to matrix space (and viceversa).

Plotting:
- plot roast results: plots electric field maps generated by ROAST, masked using a brain mask.
