This repository contains functions and scripts that I wrote during my PhD. 
Please note that I am currently updating this repository. If you spot an issue / bug, please contact me. Any help / feedback is welcome.

## List of functions/scripts and brief description:

### [Utilities](https://github.com/Davi93/mri_scripts/tree/main/utilities):
- Signal to Noise Ratio: Calculates the SNR of an fMRI image, with the possibility of specifying a mask.
- Coordinates conversion (voxel space / MNI): transforms MNI coordinates from MNI space to matrix space (and viceversa).

### [Data Visualisation](https://github.com/Davi93/mri_scripts/tree/main/plotting):
- plot roast results: plots electric field maps generated by ROAST, masked using a brain mask.
